# Persuasive Engineering

## Audience

Engineers responsible for shaping, scoping, and advocating for engineering projects within professional software departments

## Goals

- I will feel confident that I know what to do at the beginning of a research+recommendation project.
- I will be able to tell myself and others what needs to be done next on such a project.
- I will be able to explain how far we have come since we started
- I will be able to project how far we are from completion or success
- I will be able to carve out natural-feeling pause points to bookend project phases
- My teammates will enjoy working with me on projects that lack a clear initial vision and success conditions

## Non-goals

## Section ideas

- Where are we starting?
- Where do we want to go?
- How will we know we've made progress?
- What non-code artifacts and events are useful signifiers of progress?
- Do we need progress or do we need success?
- When can we declare a successful end to a phase and move on?
- Work breakdown
- Delegation
- Advocacy
- Persuasion
