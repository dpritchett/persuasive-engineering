# Persuasive Engineering

[[_TOC_]]

## Audience: Engineers responsible for 

## Goals: 
- I will feel confident that I know what to do at the beginning of a research+recommendation project.
- I will be able to tell myself and others what needs to be done next on such a project.
- I will be able to explain how far we have come since we started
- I will be able to project how far we are from completion or success
- I will be able to carve out natural-feeling pause points to bookend project phases
- My teammates will enjoy working with me on projects that lack a clear initial vision and success conditions

Non-goals:

Where are we starting?

Where do we want to go?

How will we know we've made progress?

What non-code artifacts and events are useful signifiers of progress?

Do we need progress or do we need success?

When can we declare a successful end to a phase and move on?
